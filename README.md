# FakeNewsDetector
## About the project
This project is for a web application for a user to verify the validity of a statement. The user will enter the statement that they want to verify into the user interface 
and will be presented with the label that this statement was given along with an explanation. The label given will be one of "False", "Half-true", "Mostly-True", "True",
"Barely-True", "Pants-On-Fire". These labels are taken from the dataset used for this project which is the Liar dataset. This project has been developed as my third 
year project for my degree course.
